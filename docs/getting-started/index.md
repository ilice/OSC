## First challenge: Learn how Open Smart Country Code Camp Works

Welcome to Open Smart Country Code Camp. We're an open source community that help you learn to code, then practice by building Open Smart Country project.

Learning to code is hard. To succeed, you'll need lots of proctice and support. And we need yo to develop Open Smart Country. That's why we've created an amazing curriculum and supportive community.

Open Smart Country is a proven path to your best proffesional profile. Companies are hiring thousands of people like you who have learned to code through open source projects.

There are thousands of software developer jobs currently going unfilled, and the demand for coders grows every year.

We have cogind challenges that will teach you development technologies like Node.js, databases, software containers, data analysis, data visualization and more.

We believe humans learn best by doing. So you'll spend most of your time actually building the project. We'll give you a list of specifications (agile user stories), and you'll figure out how to build components that fullfit those specifications.

Our project is divides into 4 big modules using new standards. You'll demonstrate your abilities through your GitHub profile and you'll develop your portfolio with a great stack and a real-life project.
