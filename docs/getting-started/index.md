## First challenge: Learn how Open Smart Country Code Camp Works

Welcome to Open Smart Country Code Camp. We're an open source community that help you learn to code, then practice by building Open Smart Country project.

Learning to code is hard. To succeed, you'll need lots of proctice and support. And we need yo to develop Open Smart Country. That's why we've created an amazing curriculum and supportive community.

Open Smart Country is a proven path to your best proffesional profile. Companies are hiring thousands of people like you who have learned to code through open source projects.

There are thousands of software developer jobs currently going unfilled, and the demand for coders grows every year.

We have cogind challenges that will teach you development technologies like Node.js, databases, software containers, data analysis, data visualization and more.

We believe humans learn best by doing. So you'll spend most of your time actually building the project. We'll give you a list of specifications (agile user stories), and you'll figure out how to build components that fullfit those specifications.

Our project is divides into 4 big modules using new standards. You'll demonstrate your abilities through your GitHub profile and you'll develop your portfolio with a great stack and a real-life project.

You've got guts! Let's go to your next challenge!

## Learn What to Do If You Get Stuck

Coding is hard. You will get stuck. Even experienced coders get stuck. The key is knowing how to get unstuck.

It takes time to get good at coding. You wouldn't expect to beat a chess master after playing for 3 months. Don't expect to build the next Facebook after coding for 3 months.

Keep practicing coding every day and hanging out with other people who code, and you will become a job-ready coder.

Any time you get stuck or don't know what to do next: Read-Search-Ask.

1. First, read the documentation or error message. A key skill that good coders have is the ability to interpret and then follow instructions.
1. If that didn't help, search Google. Good Google queries take a lot of practice. When you search Google, you usually want to include the language or framework you're using. You also want to limit the results to a recent period.
1. If that didn't help, ask your friends. If you have trouble, you can ask your fellow campers in our chat room.

Now you're ready to know Open Smart Country!
